# Mercure Platform.sh Template

Mercure is an open protocol for real-time communications designed to be fast, reliable and battery-efficient. It is a modern and convenient replacement for both the Websocket API and the higher-level libraries and services relying on it.

Mercure is especially useful to add streaming capabilities to REST and GraphQL APIs. Because it is a thin layer on top of HTTP and SSE, Mercure is natively supported by modern web browsers, mobile applications and IoT devices.

You should also remove the `public` directory, that is not needed for production.
